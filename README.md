api-prototype
=============

this repository implements a minimalistic API-Web-Service using node.js. Its not a starting point, just a small implementation of a route used by an ibeacon for my master course module in distributed environments and security considerations using ibeacons.

## prerequisites

You will need to have node.js and npm installed to run this application

## setup

Simply

    run npm install

to install the nessecary packages in your local project. No global packages are needed.

## run

Again simply, just

    node server.js

from project root
